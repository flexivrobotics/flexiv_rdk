"""basics4_plan_execution.py

This tutorial executes a plan selected by the user from a list of available plans. A plan is a
pre-written script to execute a series of robot primitives with pre-defined transition conditions
between 2 adjacent primitives. Users can use Flexiv Elements to compose their own plan and assign
to the robot, which will appear in the plan list.
