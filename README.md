Flexiv RDK (Robotic Development Kit), a key component of the Flexiv Robotic Software Platform, is a powerful development toolkit that enables the users to create complex and customized robotic applications using APIs that provide both low-level real-time (RT) and high-level non-real-time (NRT) access to Flexiv robots.

## Quick Start

**NOTE:** the full documentation is in [Flexiv RDK Manual](https://rdk.flexiv.com/manual/).

### C++ RDK

The C++ interface of Flexiv RDK is packed into a unified modern CMake project named ``flexiv_rdk``, which can be configured via CMake on all supported OS.

#### Compile and install for Linux

1. In a new Terminal, use ``cmake-gui`` to configure the top-level ``flexiv_rdk`` CMake project:

        cd flexiv_rdk
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake-gui .. &

2. *Configure* with default native compiler settings.
3. Choose ``BUILD_PLATFORM`` and set ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to a dedicated directory (preferably not a system path), for example ``~/rdk_install``.
4. *Configure* and *Generate*, then back to the Terminal to compile and install:

        cd flexiv_rdk/build
        make install

5. The user project can now find and link to the installed ``flexiv_rdk`` CMake package:

        cd flexiv_rdk/example
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/rdk_install
        make -j4

   Note: ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is set to the same directory where ``flexiv_rdk`` was installed to.
6. Assuming the system setup detailed in the Flexiv RDK Manual is done, to run an compiled example program:

        ./<program_name> [robot_ip] [local_ip] [...]

     Note: ``sudo`` is not required unless prompted by the program.

#### Compile and install for Mac

1. In a Terminal, use ``xcode-select`` command to invoke the installation of Xcode Command Line Tools, then follow the prompted window to finish the installation.
2. Download ``cmake-3.x.x-macos-universal.dmg`` from [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/) and install the dmg file. The minimum required version is 3.4.
3. When done, start CMake from Launchpad and navigate to Tools -> How to Install For Command Line Use. Then follow the instruction "Or, to install symlinks to '/usr/local/bin', run:" to install ``cmake`` and ``cmake-gui`` command for use in Terminal.
4. The rest steps are the same as mentioned in [Compile and install for Linux](#compile-and-install-for-linux).

#### Compile and install for Windows

1. Install any edition of Microsoft Visual Studio with version 2010 or above. Choose the "Desktop development with C++" package during installation.
2. Download ``cmake-3.x.x-windows-x86_64.msi`` from [CMake download page](https://cmake.org/download/) and install the msi file. The minimum required version is 3.4. **Add CMake to system PATH** when prompted, so that ``cmake`` and ``cmake-gui`` command can be used from Command Prompt or PowerShell.
3. Configure the ``flexiv_rdk`` CMake project using the same steps mentioned in [Compile and install for Linux](#compile-and-install-for-linux).
4. Instead of ``make install``, use ``cmake`` to compile and install it:

        cmake --build . --target INSTALL --config Release

5. Configure the user project (RDK example programs) using the same steps mentioned in [Compile and install for Linux](#compile-and-install-for-linux).
6. Instead of ``make``, use ``cmake`` to compile it:

        cmake --build . --config Release

7. To run an compiled example program:

        cd Release
        <program_name>.exe [robot_ip] [local_ip] [...]

### Python RDK

Python 3.8 is required to run Python RDK, see Flexiv RDK Manual for more details. The instruction below applies to all supported OS.

1. Check Python version is 3.8.x:

        python3 --version

2. Assume the system setup detailed in Flexiv RDK Manual is done, to run an example Python program:

        cd flexiv_rdk/example_py
        python3 <program_name>.py [robot_ip] [local_ip] [...]
